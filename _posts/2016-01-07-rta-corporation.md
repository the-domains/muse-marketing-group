# RTA
Corporation 

\#BlueOceanStrategy \#GameChanger

One
of the most exciting things Muse gets to do is work with startups. When the new
company is built by entrepreneurs who are bringing a game-changing product to
the market, it's even more exciting. The challenge is finding the best way to
communicate this new value to its ideal audience -- forward-thinking companies
that are open to doing things differently. RTA needed both branding for their
company and a unique brand for their product, which is a software-as-a-service (SAS)
solution.  
Muse
created Clara(r), the name, face, and voice of RTA's extraordinary new
service. Clara is a technology-based solution for large companies using big data.
Language around this type of business is typically quite complex, uses
excessive terminology and too many acronyms to be easily understood.

The
Website 

Muse
wrote all the language for the RTA website. we eliminated the industry-speak
and we created an interactive experience that communicates the purpose and
value of Clara(r) simply and elegantly. Like Clara itself, the RTA website takes
the complicated and makes it understandable. The site is designed to be a
self-directed presentation of the product/service. The RTA sales force (now
known as Clara-fiers) can use the company website as an introductory demo. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9ed821c-319a-4443-96f5-4c995457ee39.jpg)
